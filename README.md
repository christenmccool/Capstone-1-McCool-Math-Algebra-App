# Capstone Project 1: McCool Math Algebra App

Goals: 
1. Provide Algebra students with unlimited practice opportunities with instant feedback on a variety of key skills such as graphing lines and writing equations from situations, tables, and graph. 
2. Provide Algebra teachers with data on student practice.

Target demographic: Algebra students are ages 11-15. Teachers can monitor from 1 to many students.

API: I will create an external API to provide Algebra problems. 

Key aspects of project:
1. The database will include Student, Teacher, and Class tables. The Student table will store information on problems completed in each skill category. The Teacher table will assign one teacher to many Students, who will also be grouped into Classes.
2. The API will be created to provide many problems for each skill. 
3. Students will be able to make and set goals for a given time period.
4. Stretch goal: Create an interactive component where students can practice the same problems together in a game-like or tutoring environment.
